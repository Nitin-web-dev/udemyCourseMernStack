// Javascript Variables Exercise
// Given the existing code below, can you write some code so that their values are switched around?

var a = "3";
var b = "8";
// So that the variable a holds the value "8".

// And the variable b holds the value "3".

// When the code is run, it should output:

// a is 8

// b is 3

// Do NOT change any of the existing code.

// You are NOT allowed to type any numbers.

// You should NOT redeclare the variables a and b.



// to solve this problem 
// let another variable 'c'  and assign its value a;
let c = a;  // here c is now have value of a which is  = 3;

// then we change a  value to b which is  = 8;
a = b; // means b= 8;

// then just simply with b
b= c;


console.log(a,b)
